I'm currently coordinate two research projects tracing the impact of family and labor market reforms on gender-based inequalities in Spain.

### **FAIRLEAVE – Longer paternity leave, fairer labor markets? Evidence of the paternity leave reform in 2021 in Spain**  
Funded in 2021 by the Spanish State Research Agency (Agencia Estatal de Investigación)

The project investigates, broadly, whether the introduction of equal and non-transferable maternity and paternity leave entitlements in Spain has helped reduce gender-based equalities in the labor market, within households, and in broader society. We have collected two waves of a longitudinal survey among parents of children born before and after the reform. Results were recently featured in a [dedicated article in *El País*](https://www.aei.gob.es/en/awarded-grants/featured-grants/proyecto-idi-2020-generacion-conocimiento-bajas-paternidad-largas) and [debated in the Spanish Senate](https://www.senado.es/web/actividadparlamentaria/actualidad/video/index.html?s=15_S011030_011_01&a=264520&t=1). The project was [featured in the State Research Agency's web](https://www.aei.gob.es/en/awarded-grants/featured-grants/proyecto-idi-2020-generacion-conocimiento-bajas-paternidad-largas)(in Spanish). FAIRLEAVE is a four-year project hosted by the [Institute of Government and Public Policy](https://igop.uab.cat/en/).

### **POLGENDA – Gender-Based Public Policies and Labor Market Discrimination: A Field Experiment in Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia*  
Funded in 2024 by the [Institute of Women](https://www.inmujeres.gob.es/en/elInstituto/conocenos/home.htm), part of the Ministry of Equality in Spain

The project aims to offer causal evidence on the effectiveness—and potential unintended consequences—of gender-based family and labor market policies through a large-scale correspondence study. We are particularly interested in whether recent or prospective parenthood triggers hiring biases, particularly among prospective fathers. In addition, we test whether the presence or absence of registered equality plans in companies - following the 2021 requirement for Spanish firms to register these plans in the REGCON system - reduces discrimination or moderates the impact of family policies. The project's fieldwork will be
