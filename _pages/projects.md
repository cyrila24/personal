**Funded by:** State Research Agency (Spain)

FAIRLEAVE investigates how the design of parental leave systems shapes gender equality in the labor market, within households, and in broader society. The project compares different policy models across countries and examines how eligibility, transferability, and incentives affect the uptake and impact of leave by mothers and fathers. FAIRLEAVE is hosted at the Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona and brings together a multidisciplinary, international team of scholars.

### **POLGENDA â€“ Gender-Based Public Policies and Labor Market Discrimination**

**Full Title:** *Gender-Based Public Policies and Labor Market Discrimination: A Field Experiment in Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia*  
**Funded by:** Instituto de las Mujeres, Ministry of Equality (Spain)

POLGENDA examines labor market discrimination based on parental status and gender through a large-scale correspondence experiment. The study tests whether recent or prospective parenthood triggers hiring biases across different occupations and cities. By comparing responses to job applications sent on behalf of fictional candidates with varying family profiles, POLGENDA provides causal evidence on the effectivenessâ€”and potential unintended consequencesâ€”of gender-based labor market policies.
