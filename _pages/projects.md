I'm currently involved in two research projects tracing the impact of family and labor market reforms on gender-based inequalities in Spain.

### **FAIRLEAVE – Longer paternity leave, fairer labor markets? Evidence of the paternity leave reform in 2021 in Spain**  
Funded by the Spanish State Research Agency (Agencia Estatal de Investigación)

The project investigates, broadly, whether the introduction of equal and non-transferable maternity and paternity leave entitlements in Spain has helped reduce gender-based equalities in the labor market, within households, and in broader society. We have collected two waves of a longitudinal survey among parents of children born before and after the reform. The project was [featured in the State Research Agency's web](https://www.aei.gob.es/en/awarded-grants/featured-grants/proyecto-idi-2020-generacion-conocimiento-bajas-paternidad-largas)(in Spanish). Results were recently featured in a [dedicated article in *El País*](https://www.aei.gob.es/en/awarded-grants/featured-grants/proyecto-idi-2020-generacion-conocimiento-bajas-paternidad-largas) and [debated in the Spanish Senate](https://www.senado.es/web/actividadparlamentaria/actualidad/video/index.html?s=15_S011030_011_01&a=264520&t=1). FAIRLEAVE is hosted by the [Institute of Government and Public Policy](https://igop.uab.cat/en/). For more information, visit the [project's website](https://webs.uab.cat/fairleave/).

### **POLGENDA – Gender-Based Public Policies and Labor Market Discrimination**

**Full Title:** *Gender-Based Public Policies and Labor Market Discrimination: A Field Experiment in Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia*  
Funded by *Instituto de las Mujeres*, part of the Ministry of Equality in Spain

POLGENDA examines labor market discrimination based on parental status and gender through a large-scale correspondence experiment. The study tests whether recent or prospective parenthood triggers hiring biases. By comparing responses to job applications sent on behalf of fictional candidates with varying family profiles, POLGENDA provides causal evidence on the effectiveness—and potential unintended consequences—of gender-based family and labor market policies.
