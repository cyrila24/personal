I am [Serra Hunter](https://recercaiuniversitats.gencat.cat/ca/serra-hunter/inici/) Associate Professor of Political Science at [Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat) and Director of the [Master's Program in Political Science](https://master-ciencia-politica.uab.cat/). 

My research focuses on political behavior, gender studies, and, more recently, social policy. I have examined how party strategies, institutional contexts, and socioeconomic and gender-based inequalities condition the quality of political representation in European democracies. My current work explores the impact of family and labor market policy reforms on gender inequalities in Spain. Across these projects, my research is grounded in social psychological theory, with a strong emphasis on developing original measurement tools and identifying causal relationships.

I am currently affiliated with the research group [Democracy, Elections and Citizenship](https://webs.uab.cat/grdec/) and the [Institute of Government and Public Policy](https://igop.uab.cat/en/), both at UAB.

I received my Doctorate from the [Department of Political Science at Indiana University-Bloomington](https://polisci.indiana.edu/), with a Ph.D. Minor in Psychology. My dissertation, supervised by [Tim Hellwig](https://sites.google.com/view/thellwig/home), was published as an [award-winning book manuscript](https://cses.org/2017/06/23/marinova/) titled *Coping with Complexity: How Voters Adapt to Unstable Parties* (ECPR Press, 2016).

On this site you can find information about my [research](/personal/publications/), including replication material, and [ongoing projects](/personal/projects/) and [working papers](/personal/papers/).
