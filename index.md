I am Associate Professor of Political Science at [Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat) and Director of the [Master's Program in Political Science](https://master-ciencia-politica.uab.cat/). 

My interests lie in the areas of political behavior, gender studies and, more recently, social policy. My work has examined the consequences of party behavior, institutional context and socioeconomic and gender-based inequalities for the quality of political representation in European democracies. My current work traces the impact of family and labor market policy reforms on gender-based inequalities in Spain.

On this site you can find information about my [publications](/personal/publications/), including replication material, and ongoing [research projects](/personal/projects/), as well as my [teaching](/personal/teaching/).
