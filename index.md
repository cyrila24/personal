Welcome to my personal academic website!

I am Associate Professor of Political Science at [Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat). 

My research focuses on political behavior, social policy, and inequality. I am particularly interested in the political and social consequences of family policies, including the design and implementation of parental leave schemes.

I am the Director of the [Master's Program in Political Science](https://master-ciencia-politica.uab.cat/).

Here you can find more information about my [publications](/personal/publications/) and [research projects](/personal/projects/), as well as my [teaching](/personal/teaching/)
