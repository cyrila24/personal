ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal academic website.

I am **Dani Marinova**, Associate Professor of Political Science at the [Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat). My research focuses on political behavior, public policy, and the comparative politics of inequality. I am particularly interested in the political and social consequences of family policies, including the design and implementation of parental leave schemes.
