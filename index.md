I am Associate Professor of Political Science at [Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat). 

My research focuses political representation and accountability, with a particular insterest in how they are shaped by party systems, institutions and socioeconomic and gender-based inequalities. My current work investigates the consequences of social policy reforms, particularly the introduction of equal and non-transferable paternity leave entitlements in Spain.

I am the Director of the [Master's Program in Political Science](https://master-ciencia-politica.uab.cat/).
